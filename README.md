# rockpaperscissors2

Very simple rock paper scissors game that I would like to expand. It doesn't reload automatically which really annoys me. I made this one using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXrTIpYoCPE&ab_channel=CodewithAniaKub%C3%B3w%23JavaScriptGames but I had to make changes before it actually worked. I'm going to check out https://www.dummies.com/programming/programming-games/how-to-reset-your-html5-game/ to try to make the game better. Also, of course, there's no style.
